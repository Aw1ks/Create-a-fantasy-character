# Create-a-fantasy-character

## Project Description
This project is a Python script that generates HTML pages with descriptions of random characters for a fantasy role-playing game.

## How to use
Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Make sure all required libraries are installed with .pip
Run the script:
```
python template.py
```
The script will ask you how many characters to create. After entering the number and pressing Enter, the script will create the specified number of HTML files with character descriptions in the .characters folder

## Example
After running the script and entering a number, for example, 3, three HTML files will be created:

- characters/character_1.html
- characters/character_2.html
- characters/character_3.html

Each file will contain an HTML page with a description of one generated character. When these files are opened in a browser, the character information (name, race, class, stats, skills) will be displayed with the corresponding image.
